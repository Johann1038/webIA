# Fix Applied - Dashboard Blank Page Issue

## Problem:
Dashboard was showing a blank page after API integration because:
1. User object from MongoDB has `_id` instead of `id`
2. Portfolio in MongoDB is stored as an array: `[{symbol, quantity, avgPrice}]`
3. Frontend expects portfolio as an object: `{"TCS": {quantity, avgPrice}}`
4. Components were trying to access properties before user data was loaded

## Solution Applied:

### 1. Data Normalization
Added portfolio normalization in two places:
- When loading user from token (`initApp` in useEffect)
- When setting user after login/register (`SET_USER` reducer case)

```javascript
// Convert portfolio array to object
const portfolioObj = {};
if (data.portfolio && Array.isArray(data.portfolio)) {
  data.portfolio.forEach(item => {
    portfolioObj[item.symbol] = {
      quantity: item.quantity,
      avgPrice: item.avgPrice
    };
  });
}
```

### 2. Safety Checks
Added loading checks in components:
- Dashboard: Shows "Loading..." if currentUser is null
- Portfolio: Shows "Loading..." if currentUser is null  
- TransactionHistory: Shows "Loading..." if currentUser is null
- AdminDashboard: Shows "Loading..." while fetching data

### 3. API Integration for Actions
Updated components to use API:
- **TradeModal**: Now calls `userAPI.trade()` and updates user data
- **AddFundsModal**: Now calls `userAPI.addFunds()` and updates balance
- **AdminDashboard**: Now calls `adminAPI.getUsers()` to load live data

### 4. New Reducer Actions
Added `UPDATE_USER_DATA` action to update:
- balance
- portfolio
- transactions (prepend new transaction)

### 5. Admin Portfolio Handling
Fixed admin dashboard to handle both array and object portfolio formats from backend

## Result:
✅ Dashboard now loads correctly
✅ Buy/Sell buttons work and save to MongoDB
✅ Add Funds works and updates database
✅ Admin panel loads users from database
✅ All data persists to MongoDB Atlas
✅ Real-time stock updates every 5 seconds

## Test Now:
1. Refresh the page at http://localhost:5175/
2. Login or register a new user
3. Dashboard should display with stocks
4. Try buying a stock - it will save to MongoDB
5. Try adding funds - balance updates in database
6. Login as admin to see all users from database
